    <h2>The Red-Headed League</h2>
    <p>
      I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one
      day in the autumn of last year, and found him in deep
      conversation with a very stout, florid-faced elderly
      gentleman, with fiery red hair. With an apology for my
      intrusion, I was about to withdraw, when Holmes pulled
      me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
